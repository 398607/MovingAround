# MovingAround

## Introduction

A football simulation game written by nagizero (398607 at github) on Unity. In the game, two players will fight for their pride in the traditional football game.

Two skills are learnt by both players. "Dash" will multipy your speed limit by 2 for 5 seconds, and "Magnet" will create a solid magnet on the ground in front of you, which has a strong attraction for the ball.

	- move: axis keys
	- Dash: comma(',')
	- Magnet: period('.')

	### Player 2:
